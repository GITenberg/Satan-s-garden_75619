summary: '"Satan''s Garden" by E. Hoffmann Price is a thrilling adventure novel crafted
  in the early 20th century. Set in the mystical surroundings of Bayonne, it intertwines
  elements of occultism, supernatural horror, and intrigue. The story begins with
  Glenn Farrell and his companion Pierre d''Artois attempting to uncover the invisible
  forces tormenting a beautiful girl named Antoinette, who is caught in a terrifying
  cycle of beatings connected to an unseen evil rooted in a mysterious garden, hinting
  at a connection to hasheesh-eaters.  The opening of the narrative introduces the
  characters of Glenn Farrell and Pierre d''Artois, who are deep in contemplation
  about the strange occurrences surrounding Antoinette. As they monitor her restless
  nights, they are drawn into escalating supernatural events that culminate in a sense
  of dread, including the horrific sight of Antoinette suffering from invisible lashings.
  Struggling to comprehend the forces at play, they uncover hints of an ancient evil
  tied to the lore of the "Assassins" and the dark magic of a veiled master. The gripping
  atmosphere sets the stage for a clash between rationality and the inexplicable,
  suggesting a larger conspiracy as they resolve to protect Antoinette from her nightly
  torment and the overarching terror of "Satan''s Garden." (This is an automatically
  generated summary.)'
